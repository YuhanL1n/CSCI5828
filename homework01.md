1. Define the term essential difficulties as it is used by Brooks. 
Provide background and context with your answer and at least one 
example of an essential difficulty.

    Essential difficulties are those difficulties that are inherent,
    intrinsic and part of the nature of software engineering. When 
    we are doing a software project, no matter what tools we choose,
    we would always encounter some problems, such as complexity, 
    conformity, changeability and invisibility problems. To make 
    a specification or design a software, we need to consider those
    properties since they are inherent in the nature of software.
    For instance, users or customers are likely to make changes
    to their requirements, even an arbitrary change, which would
    require the change of software. Customers may not require your
    software to support opening a .jpg file yesterday. Then, they 
    suddenly change their mind and ask for this new feature.
    
2. Define the term accidental difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an accidental difficulty.

    Accidental difficulties are those difficulties related to the production of software. Accidental difficulties may differ depending on the development tools we are using. By switching among different tools, we may switch from one set of problems to another set of problems. For instance, when developing a software, you may choose C++ as your programming language, then you feel your development progress is slow and decide to choose Python. After switching to Python, you may face the problem of runtime speed. These problems may exist, but they are not inherent in the nature of software. You may change your editor to solve a problem, then you may face a new one.
